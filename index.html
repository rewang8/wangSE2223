                    <h1 id = "ovPadLeft">Background</h1>
                    <p class = "lead overview-font" id = "ovPadLeft">Many countries around the world do not have an adequate supply of clean water. 844 million, or one in every ten people, live on contaminated water sources. Over 80% of the wastewater and leachate in the world is released into the environment without being properly treated. It contains many pollutants and heavy metals, two of the most harmful being ammonia and lead. When there is too much ammonia in water, aquatic organisms experience difficulty expelling it from their bodies. The buildup of ammonia in organisms is toxic and will harm their tissues, potentially causing death. Ammonia toxicity can cause inflammatory responses and apoptosis in fish (Yan 2021). Too much lead is so toxic that aquatic organisms will suffer developmental and neurological issues (Ricks). Scientists are trying to find an environmentally friendly and cheap solution. Many treatments have been created to purify water, one example being activated sludge systems. An activated sludge system purifies water by turning ammonia into gaseous nitrogen and by removing phosphorus. However, these systems are expensive, and the sludge harms the environment. Aquatic plants have been observed to be effective at removing pollutants from water. They have the potential to be a cheaper and an environmentally friendly waste water treatment method.

                    <h1 id = "oPadLeft">Rationale</h1>
                    <p class = "lead overview-font" id = "oPadLeft">The lack of regular landfill sites has led to open waste dumpsites, which create a lot of leachate, the contaminated water that has flowed through the waste in the landfill. Leachate contains high levels of pollutants such as ammonia-nitrogen, heavy metals, and chemicals. When it is untreated before being released into the environment, leachate becomes a health risk to humans, plants, and animals. It will harm marine life, and may drive species to endangerment or extinction. Leachate can seep through the ground and contaminate groundwater, which is a major source of drinking water. When ingested by humans, this contaminated water can cause sweating, stomach bleeding, blood disorders, genetic disabilities, and cancer. Other possible effects leachate could have on the environment include plant damage, air pollution and climate change.

                    <p class = "lead overview-font" id = "ovPadLeft">Research Practicum is the final required research course at HTHS. In this three-marking period course, you will set up and conduct the research project you proposed in ITR.  During this course you are  required to meet with faculty mentors (and outside mentors if you are working in another facility), conduct your experiments, analyze and interpret your results and draw conclusions relevant to the rationale for your research. You will then write a comprehensive research paper, integrating the knowledge gained in both ITR and this course. At the end of this course all students are required to give a professional quality oral presentation of their work.  You will also have the opportunity to enter your research into competitions such as the Jersey Shore Science Fair and the New Jersey Academy of Science Symposium. In addition to research and data analysis skills, you will develop skills in communication, time management, organization, decision making, resource allocation, scientific ethics, and  lab safety.
