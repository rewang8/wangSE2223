                    <h3>Setting Up The Plants In The Containers</h3>
                    <p>Each species of plant came in one package, so they needed to be separated into the different testing groups. The three species of plants in the six experimental groups were precisely weighed and then divided evenly. 200 mL of water was put into a 400 mL Pyrex beaker. The container with the water was weighed on an æAdam Core Portable Compact Balance CQT 202. This balance measured to the nearest 0.01 gram. Then, the plants were put in the container and everything was weighed. The weight of only the container and water were subtracted from the total weight to get just the weight of the plants. Each species of plant was divided by four based on weight. The combination containers got one of the four parts of two plants, while the containers with only one type of plant got two parts of that specific plant. There were 28 grams of each plant, so the combination containers got 7 grams of the two plants while the one plant containers got 14 grams. To get the exact amounts of plant, the plants were put into 400 mL Pyrex beakers with 200 mL of water and measured out again with the balance. The plants were then separated into the pond water containers. The first container received 14 grams of water lettuce. The second container received 14 grams of duckweed. The third container received 14 grams of java moss. The fourth container received 7 grams of duckweed and 7 grams of java moss. The fifth container received 7 grams of duckweed and 7 grams of water lettuce. The last container received 7 grams of water lettuce and 7 grams of java moss.</p>

                    <h3>Making Solutions</h3>
                    <p>The ammonia solution for the plants was made by taking a 28 - 30% ammonium hydroxide solution and diluting it. One liter of solution was poured into a three liter bottle, and then two liters of distilled water was mixed in, making the concentration of the ammonia close to 10%. This happened two times, to make six liters of solution. The lead solution was made in a volumetric flask. 0.0216 grams of lead was weighed out on an Digital Analytical Balance Lab Precision Scale from U.S. Solid. This balance measured to the nearest 0.0001 gram. The lead was then added to the flask. Distilled water was added to the flask until the solution was 1.2 liters; the lead was diluted to 0.0018 grams lead per 100 mL. There were twelve liters of contaminated water (two liters for each container). It was made in the chemistry lab of High Technology High School.</p>

                    <h3>Setting Up The Plants in Contaminated Water Containers</h3>
                    <p>After the solutions were made, 200 mL of the pond water was measured out in a 400 mL Pyrex beaker, and then moved into a 2000 mL Pyrex beaker. Then, the plants were picked up and placed into the 2000 mL Pyrex beaker. The amount of water they displaced was recorded. Then, another 800 mL plus the amount of displaced water was put into the 2000 mL Pyrex beaker, and all of the pond water left in the container was discarded. After that, the contents in the 2000 mL Pyrex beaker were poured back into the container. A liter of ammonia solution was poured into the container, making the ammonia concentration 4 percent to 5 percent. The concentration of lead in the contaminated water was 0.0018 mg/L. One liter of the ammonia and 200 mL of lead water mixture was poured into each of the six containers. The ammonia, pH, nitrate, lead, sodium chloride, and iron levels of the water mixture were tested and recorded. The pH sensor was connected to ​​LabQuest 2 software, and a new file was created for data-collection. The storage bottle was separated from the electrode, and the bottom half of the probe was rinsed using distilled water. The probe took the pH measurements, and afterwards, the electrode was rinsed with distilled water. The electrode body was put back in the storage bottle so that the tip of the electrode is immersed in the storage solution. For ammonia, 5 milliliters of water from each of the containers were put into test tubes. 8 drops of the first solution were added into test tubes. Then, 8 drops of the second solution were put in the tube. The tube was capped, and shaken for five seconds. After five minutes, the color of the water in the tube was compared to the color chart. The lead, sodium chloride, and iron levels were measured with test strips. The test strips were dipped in the water for a few seconds. Any excess water was shaken off, and the colors of the test strip were compared to the ones on the bottle. The conditions that each of the containers were placed under were the same. They were stored in a fume hood in the teacher’s laboratory.</p>

                    <h3>Experiment Procedures and Data Collection</h3>
                    <p>The experiment ran for 14 days. The plants had the first seven days to filter the water. After that, every two to three days, the ammonia, pH, nitrate, lead, sodium chloride, and iron levels of the water in each container were recorded. The pH sensor was connected to ​​LabQuest 2 software, and a new file was created for data-collection. The storage bottle was separated from the electrode, and the bottom half of the probe was rinsed using distilled water. The probe took the pH measurements, and afterwards, the electrode was rinsed with distilled water. The electrode body was put back in the storage bottle so that the tip of the electrode is immersed in the storage solution. To measure ammonia, 5 milliliters of water from each of the containers was put into test tubes. 8 drops of the first solution were added into the test tubes. Then, 8 drops of the second solution were put in the tube. The tube was capped, and shaken for five seconds. After five minutes, the color of the water in the tube was compared to the freshwater color chart. The lead, sodium chloride, and iron levels were measured with test strips. The test strips were dipped in the water for a few seconds. Any excess water was shaken off, and the colors of the test strip were compared to the ones on the bottle. The handle of the test strip was placed at the bottom of the color chart facing upwards. The color and shape of the plants were observed and any abnormalities were recorded. This was done for each of the six containers. This process was repeated three times every time data was collected.</p>
